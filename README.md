This project created at autumn 2022
The project is a graph editor and shortest path search (Dijkstra's algorithm and others were not used, for the reason that a graph edge is represented in the general case, not a number).
1) The left mouse button allows you to create a circle, by clicking on it 2 times with the right mouse button you can set its characteristics.
2) In the delete mode, a right click deletes it.
3) In move mode, right-clicking first on the circle, then on another place in the window moves the circle there.
4) In join mode, right-clicking first on a circle, then on another circle will show an arrow from the first circle to the second.
5) In the shortest path search mode, right-clicking first on a circle, then on another circle shows the shortest path (taking into account the characteristics of the path)
from the first yeruga to the second yeruga, and in a separate window you can list which modes of transportation can not be used.
